    <h2 id="Day_1">Day 1 of Work Experience</h2>
    <p> I started my first day of work at Phorest by meeting the group of people that I would be working with and shadowing two of them in a meeting. During this meeting I learnt more about how the inner workings of a tech company works in a post pandemic world due to the fact that remote working is now an integral part of most tech based companies. After the meeting was done I installed an application called Vscode and was taught the basics of HTML and CSS and was also given the task of compiling everything that I will learn in a portfolio website to present at the end of my work experience. Later in the day I was given an intro to the coding language SQL and then I had to go home.</p>
